- How many times the users watched: this will indicate how welll the content is resonating with the users
- Number of likes, shares and comments: this will help Instagram algorithm to determine what content to prioritize in user's feed, which can lead to exposure to a large audience 
2. User Demographics
  
This includes the age, gender and location of the users, as well as what kind of content they were actively engaged in. User demographics will help to identify the target audience for specific content and also determine the advertisement strategies to be used.
3. Monetization Data

This includes the amount of ad revenue generated and how many users were converted into customers from affiliated links. This will help understand how effectively the Instagram TV is generating revenue through the various advertisements. This will also help determine user engagement with advertisements. 
### Qualitative Analysis

1. Going through the reviews to determine usersâ€™ opinions on the content and noting down recommendations
2. Taking surveys to collect feedback from users
3. Conducting tests to determine the operational quality of the TV, such as response time and playback errors

In conclusion, insights extracted from the analysis of the metrics listed above will enable informed decision-making that improves Instagram TV performance.
